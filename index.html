<img src="images/sffont.png" alt="">

<p>Today I read an <a href="https://medium.com/@mach/the-secret-of-san-francisco-fonts-4b5295d9a745#.20c8elx2o">interesting article</a> about San Francisco, the new font created by Apple for its iOS9.</p>

<p>The San Francisco is considered a “digital native” font for the digital age. The font was designed to be easy read in any screen and device (from small watches to big retina displays).</p>

<p>It is interesting how the font do not use legibility if it is used in a interface for small devices. I think we will see more “digital native fonts” in the next years.</p>

<p>When books become digital, they also become data. I think it's open opportunities to many things like discovering written patterns by text-mining techniques. One opportunity, of course, is to run queries in a bunch of books. 

<p>Today I discovered an application that do that. The name is <a href="http://www.cleanreaderapp.com">Clean Reader</a></p>. 

<p>The app does a searching in all of your books and cleaning up texts that are considered obscene. The technology open path for censorship. But I think it is one more example how technology is a double-edge sword.</p>

<img src="images/kindle.png" alt="">

<p>The research Information published an interesting article about <a href="http://www.researchinformation.info/features/feature.php?feature_id=541">innovation in the publishing field</a>. According to the article, innovation is essential if a publishing company want  to survive in the future.  The expectations of digital readers is becoming higher and higher.</p>

<p>I highlighted one excerpt:  </p>

<blockquote>
<p>"So our player technologies, for example, can’t be simple play buttons they have to be interactive apps in their own right, and that’s why we develop things like synchronised transcripts, and clip making capabilities, annotation capabilities, and playlisting is very important."</p>
</blockquote>

<p>In other words, digital readers are demanding more and more discoverability</p>

<img src="images/week4.png" alt="">

<p>At Teleread weblog, website focus on ebooks, I found an <a href="http://www.teleread.com/books/book-on-design-is-shaped-like-an-ipadbut-so-what/">interesting article</a> about Skeuomorphism on electronic publishing. The traditional trend is that ebooks try to emulate elements from printed book. But according to Brian Sollism, digital consultant, the reverse movement is happening - printed books are starting to using design elements from ebook.</p> 
<p>A book is a book, but it is very inspiring to see this movement.</p>

<a id="week-5" class="anchor" href="#week-5" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Week 5 - Good guide about coding a ebook</h3>

<img src="images/book.png" alt="">

<p>Today I bought for only US$ 3 a <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0321734688">good book about coding ebooks</a>. The author Elizabeth Castro did a good job. Some parts are outdated, of course. But, in general, the basic is there - how to code an ebook from scratch</p>

<h3><a id="week-6" class="anchor" href="#week-6" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Week 6 - Javascript library for ebooks</h3>

<img src="images/javascript.png" alt="">  

<p>Apple has a long history of providing good documentation for their softwares. The company has a good guideline about how to develop an epub for their iBook platform. (<a href="https://itunesconnect.apple.com/docs/iBooksAssetGuide5.1Revision2.pdf">iBooks Asset Guide</a>) Also, the company provides a Javascript library (ibook.js). This library is a great tool if you want to add interactive to ebooks (iPad and iPhone). For example, you can add the function of drag and drop ou embeded audio by simply adding some lines of code to the ebook HTML</p>

<iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/_GUDxBAt8XM" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe>

<p>Today I was talking with a friend about the project of <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/newsgraphics/2015/nytvr/">virtual reality of The New York Times</a>. It is an interesting form of storytelling. I think e-books can also use this kind of sortytelling enanled by technology. The video above is an interesting hands-on with the technology. </p>

<h3><a id="week-8" class="anchor" href="#week-8" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Week 8 - Tutorials for fixed-layout iBooks</h3>

<img src="images/fixed.png" style="text-align: center;" alt="">

<p>During my search to find alternative tutorials to create fized-layour ePubs, I found this <a href="http://fantasycastlebooks.com/Tutorials/tutorial-index.html">useful website</a> from R. Scot Johns. The author shares his experience of self-publishing books. The highlighgted is the tutorial that he create about how to create fixed-layout ebook.</p>

<h3><a id="week-9" class="anchor" href="#week-9" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Week 9 - eBooks and minimalism</h3>

<p>This week I will post a quick link but very inspiring. The canvas website published a <a href="https://designschool.canva.com/blog/minimalist-design-beautiful-examples-and-practical-tips/">list of 25 beautiful examples</a> of minimalist design. </p>

<h3><a id="week-10" class="anchor" href="#week-10" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Week 10 - Open textbooks and Creative Commons</h3>

<img src="images/opentext.png" alt="">

<p>The Creative Commons published an <a href="https://stateof.creativecommons.org/2015/">interesting report</a> about which media have been licensed by them. They show that the number of textbooks licensed have increased. This is interesting because shows how the digital publications help to solve problems of education around the world.</p>

<h3><a id="week-11" class="anchor" href="#week-11" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Reading ePubs on iPhone</h3>

<img src="images/read.png" style="text-align: center;" alt="">

<p>It is always good to see alternatives to the Amazon/Apple ecosystem. Today I started to use the app <a href="https://medium.com/@readapp/introducing-read-for-ios-de4d2799254a#.ihnqqxm8m">Read</a>. It is a very useful app to read EPUB on iPhone. 

  In every detail, there is the concept 'mobile first'. Highly recommended.</p>
